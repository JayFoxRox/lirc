LIRC upstream Debian packaging
==============================

This is an upstream packaging of LIRC. Upstream packaging is basically a
Bad Thing and should be avoided for many reasons. This is just
a provisionary sketch to make recent versions of LIRC more available
for Debian users since the official release channel seems to be stalled
at 0.9.0.

Building this package conflicts with the libirman package which must be
removed prior to building. Resolving this requires a downstream update
of the libirman package to provide also a shared library. See
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=%20801588

Also, be aware that this packaging makes no attempt, none, to migrate
the current Debian-based configuration. In particular, the hardware.conf
file is not used in any way by this package.  Refer to the upstream docs
for how to configure LIRC (available in the lirc-doc package).

Usage sketch (create a dist package and install build tools + deps):
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts debhelper pbuilder git
    $ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/lirc/git lirc
    $ cd lirc
    $ dpkg-builddeps
    # If anything is listed, install it using apt-get install
    $ autoreconf -fi
    $ ./configure
    $ make dist
    $ ls lirc*gz
    lirc-0.9.4-devel.tar.gz

Usage sketch (create debian source package from dist package)

    $ mkdir lirc-git
    $ cd lirc-git
    $ cp some/path/lirc-0.9.4-devel.tar.gz lirc_0.9.4-devel.orig.tar.gz
    $ tar xf lirc_0.9.4-devel.orig.tar.gz
    $ cd lirc-0.9.4-devel
    $ debuild -S -us -uc
    $ cd ..; ls
    lirc                                lirc_0.9.4-devel-1.1_source.build
    lirc_0.9.4-devel-1.1.debian.tar.xz  lirc_0.9.4-devel-1.1_source.changes
    lirc_0.9.4-devel-1.1.dsc            lirc_0.9.4-devel.orig.tar.gz


Use 'sudo pdebuild' (no options) instead of 'debuild -S' to build binary
packages. This leaves output in /var/cache/pbuilder/result
