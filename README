0.9.1-pre3 README

  * Added systemd support: unit files, socket activation. Clients such as
    irexec can now trust that the lircd socket is available from start.
  * Building kernel modules is not supported (although the code is still
    in place).
  * New config file lirc_options.conf with cli options default values.
    Using this file there is no need for environment files in the
    lircd.socket systemd configuration.
  * 'make install' now installs default configuration files inte /etc. This
    can be disabled using the --install-etc configure option.
  * Automagically sets the lirc protocol for /sys/class/rc devices - no need
    for 'echo lirc > /sys/class/rc/rc0/protocols' or similar udev rule.
  * Whitespace cleanup and git hook to enforce whitespace handling.
  * Bugfixes
  * docs: Added new Configuration Guide.
  * Docs are built s part of normal build process.
  * Autotools update and Darwin fixes.
