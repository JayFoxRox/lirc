      First, lirc is packaged for all major linux distributions. If you
      just want to use lirc, you should be able to install it like any
      other package. This way, you want have to look at the
      dependencies, build and installation description found here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several scripts need the python3 PyYaml package at
      http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML. Overall, python3 is used for
      many support scripts. The configuration script needs python3-gi and
      thus also thge Gtk libs.
    </p>

    <P>
      If you want to compile and use all tools, you also d an
      installed <em>svgalib</em> (used by <em>smode2</em>) and the X
      Windows header files (needed by <em>irxevent</em> and
      <em>xmode2</em>). You can get svgalib from <A
        HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/">
        ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/</A>. The
      configure script will notify you if some necessary files are
      missing and the according tools won't be compiled.

    <P>
      <B>Irman (=UIR) :</B> To use your Irman with LIRC you need the
      latest <A HREF="http://www.lirc.org/software/snapshots/">
      <em>libirman</em></A> library. At the time this has been written
      the current libirman version was 0.4.3. Former versions won't
      work. Please also read <A HREF="#updating">Updating from
      lirc-0.5.4</A>.
    </P>

    <A NAME="kernel"></A>

    <P>
      As of 0.9.1+, lirc uses the kernel modules from the official
      kernel. Some of these are formerly lirc modules which are
      now part of the kernel. Thus, building lirc does not involve
      building kernel modules (as it used to be).
    </P>
    <p>
      Some of the former lirc modules are part of the official kernel
      and should be available on any reasonably updated system. However,
      some are in the staging area; if they are part of your kernel
      depends on the distro you use (unless of course if you compile
      your own kernel).
    <P>
    <P>
      If you want to use a home-brew receiver, an Anir Multimedia
      Magic, a Packard Bell receiver, the IRdeo or if you want to use
      the SIR IrDA driver, I suggest that you use the lirc_serial
      or lirc_sir module.  Usually the serial port driver grabs all
      ports it auto-detects as soon as it is loaded and the LIRC
      modules won't be able to use any of them.
    </P>

    <P>
      There are two solutions for this problem. Either you load the
      LIRC module before the kernel serial port driver is loaded
      (that's why you have to compile it as a module) or you call
      <em>setserial /dev/ttySx uart none</em> to release the according
      port. setserial usually is already called during boot-up in some
      init script whose location depends on the distribution you
      use.  If you tell setserial to
      configure a port that is already claimed by a LIRC module, the
      kernel serial driver will steal the port from the LIRC module
      and LIRC will stop working. So check your setserial
      configuration to only configure available ports. Debian users
      should adjust their <em>/etc/serial.conf</em>.
    </P>

    <P>
      <B>TV cards:</B> To use any remote control receivers connected
      directly to a bttv based TV card you will need a working bttv
      setup in your kernel. For most TV cards we rely on bttv
      autodetection. That way you don't have to give any parameters to
      the module as they are selected internally depending on the
      information the bttv module gives us. This means that you should
      pay attention that your TV card is detected correctly by bttv.
    </P>
    <P>
      <B>Technisat MediaFocus I:</B> You will have to install the <A

      Generally speaking everything that can receive or send infrared
      signals can be supported by LIRC. The project began with support
      for home-brew receivers and transmitters for the serial port and
      later support for analogous hardware for the parallel port was
      added. At that time the focus of the project was to provide an
      infrared solution that is both very cheap and easy to
      assemble. The following links point to instructions how to build
      your own receiver/transmitter.

      Since 0.9.1+ , lirc loads drivers dynamically. This means that

    <P>
      <B>Note:</B> You won't find a configure script in the source repo

    <P>
      Installing the compiled programs is really easy, just type
      <em>make install</em>. All binaries and modules should be
      installed at the usual places. The necessary devices should be
      generated in the <em>/dev/</em> directory and all configuration
      files should be copied to its proper destination if you happen
      to use some hardware where configuration files are already
      available.
    </P>

    <P>
      When you are using <em>devfs</em> or <em>sysfs</em> with your
      kernel, the /dev/lirc device node will disappear again once you
      reboot your machine. In that case the LIRC kernel module will
      generate the required entry every time it is loaded. But the
      device node won't be visible as /dev/lirc, but might be located
      in a different location like e.g. /dev/lirc/0. Please be aware
      of this fact when starting programs that access the device node
      like mode2 or lircd. You will have to use the --device command
      line option of these programs to point them to the correct
      location. When using sysfs together with the udev daemon you
      should copy the <em>lirc.rules</em> file located in the contrib
      directory of the source package to
      <em>/etc/udev/rules.d/</em>. This will make sure that the device
      node will be created.
    </P>
    <P>
      The core program of LIRC is <em>lircd</em>, the LIRC system
      daemon that does all of the decoding of infrared signals. LIRC
      comes with a second daemon program: <em>lircmd</em>. lircmd
      depends on lircd and translates remote control activity to mouse
      movements. Just like all other daemons both lircd and lircmd
      should be started at system boot time and do their work in
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to start them automatically at boot time a systemd
      setup will be installed by default. The <em>contrib</em>directory
      contains examples for other init systems and distributions.
      you will have to edit  this for your system.
    </P>

    <P>
      <B>Warning:</B> Never compile daemons with &quot;Disable
      daemonize&quot; turned on and place them in some init script
      unless you have a rescue disc nearby...
    </P>

    <P>
      Now you should adjust the file permissions of
      <em>/var/run/lirc/lircd</em> (this is the Unix domain socket that clients
      use to connect to lircd) so others than <em>root</em> can
      connect to lircd.</P>
    <PRE>
        chmod 666 /var/run/lirc/lircd</PRE>
    <P>
      should do. You can also create a special group for this purpose.
    </P>

    <P>
      If your hardware requires a kernel module you should make sure
      that the kernel will find the correct module if a program tries
      to access <em>/dev/lirc</em>. This can be done by inserting the
      following line to your <em>/etc/conf.modules</em>
      (<em>/etc/modules.conf</em> for current kernel versions):
    </P>
    <PRE>
        alias char-major-61  lirc_driver</PRE>
    <P>
      Note that here <em>driver</em> is a placeholder for the actual
      driver you are using (serial, parallel, etc.).
    </P>

    <P>
      If your driver requires some special parameters to work you can
      specify them at the same place. For example you can set the IRQ
      and I/O base the serial port drivers shall use by adding the
      following line to <em>/etc/conf.modules</em>:</P>
    <PRE>
        options lirc_serial irq=4 io=0x3e8</PRE>
    <P>
      Finally you might want to add <em>/usr/local/lib</em> to
      <em>/etc/ld.so.conf</em> so the <em>lirc_client</em> library is
      found by the run-time linker. Don't forget to call
      <em>ldconfig</em> afterwards for the change to take effect.

      <em>modprobe lirc_serial sense=0</em> if your receiver circuit is active

      driver. If you want to get the old behaviour of the driver
      (deprecated) you can insert the module using the
      <em>threshold=2</em> parameter. The default of
      <em>threshold</em> is now set to 3. You might even want to try
      higher values.

      When you are using LIRC with the <B>Linux input layer</B>
      driver, make sure that your config file contains the following
      line in its header:
    </P>
    <pre>
        bits 32
    </pre>
    <P>
      Otherwise lircd will not recoginise any events.

      There is a new program that you probably want to use: <A
      HREF="lircrcd.html">lircrcd</a> reads the .lircrc config file
      and synchronises the mode that the LIRC clients using this
      config file (irexec, irxevent, etc.) are in. Using lircrcd has
      to be explicitly enabled in the config file by adding the
      following line at the beginning of the file:
<pre>
#! lircrcd

      Newly added iMon LCD displays with device ids 15c2:0038 and 15c2:0045
      use a larger buffer to enable all remote and panel buttons. Consequently,
      config files for earlier iMon receivers are not compatible with these
      new devices, and vice versa. Be sure to select the appropriate 64-bit
      config for a newer iMon LCD. (Early cvs support for the 0038 used only
      a 32-bit buffer).
      <em>For the 0038: remotes/imon/lircd.conf.imon-ultrabay</em>.

      The behaviour of the <em>quit</em> flag in the <A
        HREF="configure.html#lircrc_format">.lircrc</A> config file
      has changed slightly concerning button sequences. Previously the
      quit flag had no effect on button sequences which had partly
      been entered. Now the quit flag will make execution of further
      configurations stop even though just part of the button sequence
      has been entered.

      There was an interface change in the <em>lirc_dev</em> kernel
      module. If you get an error message like
<PRE>
lirc_serial: Unknown symbol lirc_unregister_driver
lirc_serial: Unknown symbol lirc_register_driver
</PRE>
    when trying to load any of the lirc kernel modules, then you have
    probably an old version of <em>lirc_dev</em> loaded. Make sure
    that the <em>lirc_dev</em> version that comes with this release is
    loaded.

      The lircd socket was moved from <em>/dev/lircd</em> to
      <em>/var/run/lirc/lircd</em> to conform to the Filesystem Hierarchy
      Standard. The default pid file location was moved from
      <em>/var/run/lircd.pid</em> to <em>/var/run/lirc/lircd.pid</em>.
    </P>
    <P>
      The default location of lircd, lircmd and lircrcd config files
      was moved to <em>/etc/lirc/lircd.conf</em>,
      <em>/etc/lirc/lircmd.conf</em> and <em>/etc/lirc/lircrc</em>. If
      the config files are not found in that location, they are still

      The functionality of the <em>lirc_mceusb2</em> driver has been
      merged into the <em>lirc_mceusb</em> driver. The
      <em>lirc_mceusb2</em> driver is now obsolete and has been
      removed. You should use <em>lirc_mceusb</em> from now on.

    <p>
    Building kernel modules is not supported from 0.9.1.  Most tests are
    done using 'with-driver=userspace'. Using other options is deprecated
    and will not be supported in upcoming releases.</p>
    <p>
    From 0.9.1 it's not necessary to setup the kernel rc driver using
    something like 'echo "lirc" > /sys/class/rc/rco/protocol"; this is
    done automagically by lircd. Doing it twice does no harm. </p>
    <p>
    values, normally /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf. The idea is that
    setting up the lirc services should not be distribution dependent. </p>
    <p>
    From 0.9.1 lirc has a rather complete systemd support. By default,
    services are installed in /usr/lib/systemd/system. Note that the
    service to run lircd is lircd.socket, not lircd.service. </p>
    <p>
    From 0.9.1 the documentation is built by a plain make (earlier, this
    required a specific target). As a result, the built docs are not part
    of the distribution. Note that ./ configure affects how the docs
    are generated. </p>
    <p>
    By default, stub configuration files are installed. This can be disabled
    using the new --with-install-etc configure option. </p>
