.SH DESCRIPTION
This program will record the signals from your remote control and create
a config file for lircd. A proper config file for lircd is maybe the
most vital part of this package, so you should invest some time to
create a working config file. Although I put a good deal of effort in
this program it is often not possible to automatically recognize all
features of a remote control.

If the program fails to recognize the protocol of the remote control you
should use the \-\-force option to at least create a config file in raw mode.

If \fIfile\fR already exists and contains a valid config irrecord will use the
protocol description found there and will only try to record the
buttons. This is very useful if you want to learn a remote where config
files of the same brand are already available. Of course this will only
work if the remotes use the same protocol but it's worth a try. You will
find template files for the most common protocols in the
remotes/generic/ directory of this package. The name of the new file is
created by appending .conf to the given filename in this case.
.SH OPTIONS

\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
display this message
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-version\fR
display version
.TP
\fB\-a\fR \fB\-\-analyse\fR
Analyse a raw_codes config file, trying to convert it to a
regular configuration.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fB\-\-force\fR
Force raw mode. Use this if recording fails otherwise. This
creates a raw codes configuration file which can be used as-is
or converted using the -a option.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fB\-\-disable\-namespace\fR
disables namespace checks
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fB\-\-list\-namespace\fR
list valid button names
.TP
\fB\-H\fR \fB\-\-driver\fR=\fIdriver\fR
Use given driver. -H help lists available drivers.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fB\-\-device\fR=\fIdevice\fR
read from given device
.TP
\fB\-D\fR \fB\-\-debug\fR=\fIlevel\fR
Set debug level, a value between 1 and 10. 10 gives most output. Values
0..7 corresponds to the syslog levels LOG_CRIT..LOG_DEBUG.
.SH "DRIVER LOADING"
Drivers are loaded dynamically. The directory used for this is determined by (falling
priority):
.IP \- 2
The --plugindir option if available.
.IP \- 2
The 'plugindir' entry in  the [lircd] section of the lirc_options.conf file.
.IP \- 2
The environment variable LIRC_PLUGINDIR.
.IP \- 2
A hardcoded default (usually /usr/lib[64]/lirc/plugins).
