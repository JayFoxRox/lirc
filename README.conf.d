/etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d README
=============================

Files in this directory are automatically included, much the same way
as if theire was a "include" directive for it in lircd.conf. For this to
work, the filename must match '*.conf'.

You might want to symlink files elseware to this directory,
naming the link to 'something.conf'.
